## 🎮 About the Project

Conquer's Command is a feature-rich RTS prototype developed entirely in Unity using C#.  
Inspired by classics like *Command & Conquer*, this project focuses on core RTS mechanics, optimized systems, and scalable architecture—built with performance and clarity in mind.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Development is currently on hold. This project was a solo effort, and busy with life.
